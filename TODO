The current development of Jarsync is focused on the rsync-compatible
client and server programs. The tasks in this area include:

	* Implement the command-line version of the server (that rsync
	  invokes over ssh/rsh).

	* Add local transfers.

	* Add pure Java SSH and RSH tunneling (the former will probably
	  use SSHTools; I would like to use my own HUSH codebase, but
	  SSHTools looks more mature).

	* Finish the blocking and nonblocking "socket" daemons.

	* Assert that the file-handling is compatible (or, at least,
	  workalike).

	* Add ways to manipulate UID/GID, modes, links, devices, etc.

	* Implement compression in the delta encoding and decoding. See
	  the PlainDelta*coder classes for the non-compressed version,
	  and see token.c in the rsync distrubution.

	* Make sure the rsync methods can be accessed easily
	  programmatically for new programs.

	* Implement a GUI.
