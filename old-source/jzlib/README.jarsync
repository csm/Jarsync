The version of jzlib inlcuded here has been modified for use with
jarsync, in a similar fashion to how the zlib included with rsync has
been modified. The example files and the MindTerm patch are also
removed, since they have no use here.

The only change is the addition of Z_INSERT_ONLY flush value, which
allows for efficient history updating without emitting data.

The file `jzlib.diff' in this directory contains the extent of the
differences between the jzlib-0.0.8 source tree and this one.
